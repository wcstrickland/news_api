## Phase 1
Created a web scraping program that requests html from a major news outlet and then parses the request return via tags. The result is a json like object that includes:
* the date and time the article was printed in UTC
* The single word topic
* The main headline
* The one sentence sub headline
* And the URL for the article.
 
This information is then compared against a data base and if any of the scraped articles are not currently in the database they are added.

## Phase 2
Created a front facing API that allows users to search the data base with high level of specificity through a series of endpoints. This api supports programming language interaction but can be searched via the URL in the browser by anyone.

## Phase 3 
Created a simple static html page with  a brief description of the APIâ€™s endpoints and provided examples on how to properly use them.
