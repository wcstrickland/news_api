        <p class="picture-text">
            The articles contained in this database consist of:<br>1. The date they were published.
            <br>2. The topic
            <br>3. The "headline"
            <br>4. An expanded headline labeled the summary.
            <br>5. The url to the article
        </p>
        <h2>Searching the database</h2>
        <p class="search-instructions">
            The API allows you to search the database in a number of ways:
            <br>*By time frame of publishing.
            <br>*By occurrence of a key word in a particular field.
            <br>*A combination of the two.
            <br>
            <br>For example you could search for all of the articles from November 14th - November 21st where the headline included the word emergency.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, you can filter the out put of your search to provide only selected fields.
            <br>
            The example search described previously could be tailored to yield only the URL for the resulting articles.
        </p>
        <h3>Searching by date</h3>
        <p class="search-date">
            To search by date:
            <br>Follow the url to this page with /daterange/"From date"/"To date"
            <br><br>
            An example would look like:
            <br> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/daterange/2020-10-31/2020-11-10">http://127.0.0.1:5000/daterange/2020-10-31/2020-11-10</a>
            <br>
            This would provide all articles published between Oct. 31st and Nov. 10th.
        </p>
         <h3>Searching by keyword</h3>
        <p class="search-key">
            To search by keyword:
            <br>Follow the url to this page with /key/"The part of the headline you want to search"/"The key word you are looking for"
            <br><br>
            An example would look like:
            <br> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/key/topic/Joe">http://127.0.0.1:5000/key/topic/Joe</a>
            <br>
            This would provide all articles where the word "Joe" appeared in the "Topic"
        </p>
        <h3>Combining date a search</h3>
        <p class="search-key-date">
            To combine the two:
            <br>Follow the url to this page with /keyrange/"From date"/"To date"/"The part of the headline you want to search"/"The key word you are looking for"
            <br><br>
            An example would look like:
            <br> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/keyrange/2020-10-31/2020-11-10/topic/Joe">http://127.0.0.1:5000/keyrange/2020-10-31/2020-11-10/topic/Joe</a>
            <br>
            This would provide all articles where the word "Joe" appeared in the "Topic" during the specified range.
        </p>
        <h3>Filtering Results</h3>
        <p class="filter">
            To filter result output:
            <br>Follow the url to this page with /specific/"desired field"/"From date"/"To date"/"The part of the headline you want to search"/"The key word you are looking for"
            <br><br>
            An example would look like:
            <br> <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/specific/url/2020-10-31/2020-11-10/topic/Joe">http://127.0.0.1:5000/specific/url/2020-10-31/2020-11-10/topic/Joe</a>
            <br>
            This would provide <strong>just the url's</strong> for all articles where the word "Joe" appeared in the "Topic" during the specified range.
        </p>
        <h3>Word clouds</h3>
            <div class="cloud">
            <p class="word-cloud">
                When searching by either date or by key word the resulting list of articles <br>can have their content combined and a word cloud <br>visualization of the most common words produced.
                <br>This excludes "stop words" such as "the", "but", "and" etc.
                <br><br>
                At the end of a search simply add /cloud.
                <br> http://127.0.0.1:5000/key/topic/Joe/cloud
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cloud-image">
            <img src="static/images/new_cloud.png" alt="example">
        </div>
